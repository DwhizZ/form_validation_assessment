Done: Your folder structure for each page should look like this:

page1/ (page1 is not a suitable name... you can call it "login" or "login_page")
    |
    |
    -----> views/ (This folder will contain your main widget for the page and a components folder)
    -----> providers/ (This folder will contain all the providers for this page)


By doing this, you have properly and correctly separated your UI from your logic/state.
